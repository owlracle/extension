This is a Chrome extension for the Owlracle service.
If you don't know about Owlracle, I reccomend you to visit [our website](https://owlracle.info).

Asked by the community, now Owlracle can be used without leaving your current tab, just opening the extension popup.

## Installation

**We are still waiting on the Chrome Web Store Approval**. If you dont want to wait, you can just download the [owlracle-ext-v1.0.zip](https://github.com/owlracle/extension/releases/tag/1.0) file from the release page.

* Extract the file contents into an empty folder.
* Head to the chrome extension settings: (_chrome://extensions/_) and make sure _Developer Mode_ is checked.
* Click on _Load unpacked_ button, and select the folder you just put the zip contents into.
* Done!

## Usage

Just click on the new extension button that just appeared on yout browser. A popup will show.

Once opened, you must choose to login with your API key or use a guest login. Every request made on the extension will count towards your api key limit. Note that using an api key will grant you a much higher usage limit. Refer to the api limits on [our website](https://owlracle.info).

The extension have three menu buttons located in the bottom.

* The first is to check gas prices. It makes requests with the default Owlracle settings:

```
blocks = 200
percentile = 0.3
accept = 35,60,90,100
version = 2
```

You can change the desired network on the button in the header, just like in our website.

* The second tab is for gas price history. Just like in our website, you can change the timeframe (_10m_, _30m_, _1h_, _2h_, _4h_, _1d_), the chart style (_area_ or _candlesticks_) and the information you want to track (_gas price_, _token price_, _estimated gas fee_).

* The third tab shows information about your api key, or a message asking for you to log in with your key, if you still haven't. In this tab you can see your _api credit_, _last hour api usage_, and _total api usage_, as well as a convenient link to our social media profiles.
